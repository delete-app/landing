> Why do you keep texting them even when they take 3 days to reply? Or why do you feel suffocated the moment someone gets too close? It's not random. It's your attachment style.

## The Four Attachment Styles

Attachment theory is the most validated framework we have for understanding relationship patterns. Developed by John Bowlby in the 1960s and extended to adult relationships by Hazan & Shaver in 1987, it explains why you do what you do in relationships.

### Secure (~50% of people)
- Comfortable with intimacy *and* independence
- Can communicate needs without drama
- Don't play games or test partners
- Trust comes naturally (but isn't blind)

### Anxious (~20% of people)
- Fear of abandonment runs deep
- Hypervigilant to partner's moods and texts
- Need reassurance, sometimes too much
- When things are good, you're great. When uncertain, you spiral.

### Avoidant (~25% of people)
- Discomfort with emotional closeness
- Value independence above connection
- Shut down when things get intense
- Partners often feel like they're "chasing" you

### Disorganized (~5% of people)
- Mix of anxious and avoidant, often switching between them
- Relationships feel chaotic
- Usually stems from early trauma or inconsistent caregiving
- Want closeness but fear it

## The Research

Hazan & Shaver's 1987 study first applied attachment theory to adult romantic love.<sup>[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511)</sup> Since then, hundreds of studies have confirmed:

- Attachment styles predict relationship satisfaction, conflict patterns, and breakup likelihood
- Attachment shows moderate stability over time, though it can change with significant life events or relationships<sup>[[2]](https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0602_03)</sup>
- Securely attached people have longer, more satisfying relationships
- Anxious-avoidant pairings are common — and often volatile

*Note: Attachment percentages (50% secure, 20% anxious, etc.) are approximations based on multiple studies and vary by population and measurement method. The exact distribution differs across cultures and research samples.*

## Examples

**Meera (Anxious)** checks Rahul's "last seen" status 20 times a day. When he's slow to reply, she drafts responses, deletes them, worries she said something wrong. When they're together, she's happy. When apart, she's anxious. She knows it's "too much" but can't stop.

**Vikram (Avoidant)** starts strong in relationships — attentive, present, engaged. But around the 2-3 month mark, he needs "space." Partners feel him pulling away. He's not being dishonest — closeness genuinely feels suffocating to him.

**Ananya (Secure)** had an anxious ex and an avoidant ex. With the anxious one, she reassured but didn't enable. With the avoidant one, she gave space but maintained her standards. Neither worked, but she didn't lose herself in either.

## Reflection

- Which style resonated most with you?
- Think about your last 2-3 relationships. Do you see a pattern?
- Have partners ever said things like "you're too needy" or "you're emotionally unavailable"?

## One Thing to Know

Your attachment style isn't a life sentence. Research shows that with awareness and the right relationship (often with a secure partner), insecure attachment can shift toward secure.

The first step is just knowing what you're working with.
