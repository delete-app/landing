> You'd never let a friend talk to you the way you talk to yourself. So why do you let partners treat you worse than you treat yourself?

## The First Relationship

Your relationship with yourself is your first relationship. It sets the template for everything that follows.

If you believe you're not enough — not attractive enough, not successful enough, not interesting enough — you'll date from that place. You'll:
- Feel "lucky" when someone wants you (and tolerate more than you should)
- Chase people who aren't available (because available feels "too easy")
- Self-sabotage when things go well (because you don't believe you deserve it)
- Accept crumbs and call them a meal

This isn't about "loving yourself first" in a bumper-sticker way. It's about understanding that your self-perception directly shapes your dating patterns.

## The Inner Critic

That voice in your head — the one that says you're boring, that your jokes aren't funny, that you'll end up alone — it's been there a long time. It started as protection: don't get your hopes up, expect rejection first, stay small so you don't get hurt.

But in dating, the inner critic becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy:

- You don't approach people because "they're out of your league"
- You over-explain and apologize because you assume you're annoying
- You don't ask for what you want because you don't believe you deserve it
- You stay in bad situations because "this is probably the best I can get"

The inner critic isn't telling you the truth. It's telling you what it learned long ago.

## The Research

Studies on self-esteem and relationship quality consistently show:<sup>[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.995)</sup>

- People with low self-worth stay in unsatisfying relationships longer
- They're more likely to interpret neutral partner behavior as rejection
- They show more jealousy and insecurity
- They idealize partners who treat them poorly

The flip side: people with secure self-worth:
- Set clearer boundaries
- Leave unhealthy relationships faster
- Are less reactive to relationship turbulence
- Report higher satisfaction even in imperfect relationships

## Examples

**Priyanka** stayed with a guy who belittled her career for two years. Friends asked why. Deep down, she thought: "At least someone wants me." She wasn't aware of this belief — it just ran in the background, making bad treatment feel acceptable.

**Amit** kept chasing women who were emotionally unavailable. When someone was genuinely interested and available, he lost interest. He told himself they "weren't challenging enough." Really, he didn't believe someone available could actually want him — there must be something wrong with them.

**Shreya** spent a year single, working on her inner critic. She started therapy, journaled, noticed the self-talk. When she started dating again, she was different. She walked away from the first red flag. She asked for what she wanted. She dated differently — because she saw herself differently.

## The "Being Single" Test

Here's a test: How do you feel about being single?

- If single = failing, desperate, "left behind" → you'll partner from fear
- If single = fine, working on yourself, not settling → you'll partner from choice

The best relationships happen when you don't *need* them. Not because you're above love, but because you're not running from yourself.

## Reflection

- How do you talk to yourself when you make a mistake?
- When you look in the mirror on a bad day?
- When you're alone on a Saturday night?

Would you date someone who talked to you that way?

## One Thing to Try

For one week, notice your self-talk. When the inner critic shows up (and it will), pause and ask:

*"Would I say this to someone I love?"*

If not, you're not being honest with yourself — you're being cruel. Start treating yourself like someone you're responsible for caring for.
