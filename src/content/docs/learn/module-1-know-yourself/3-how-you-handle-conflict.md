> Last fight you had — did you yell, walk away, go silent, or just agree to make it stop? That reaction wasn't random. It's been your pattern for years.

## The Four Responses

When conflict arises, your nervous system picks a survival strategy. These patterns, sometimes called the "4 Fs," were adaptive once. In adult relationships, they often cause more problems than they solve.

*Note: Fight, flight, and freeze are well-established stress responses in psychology. "Fawn" is a newer addition popularized by therapist Pete Walker in the context of complex trauma. While clinically useful, fawn is not yet a formally recognized stress response in academic literature — consider it an emerging clinical concept.*

### Fight
- Voice rises, body tenses
- Need to "win" the argument
- Defensiveness kicks in immediately
- Hard to back down, even when wrong

### Flight
- Leave the room, change the subject
- Stonewall — go silent, refuse to engage
- "I need space" becomes an escape, not a pause
- Partners feel abandoned mid-conflict

### Freeze
- Go blank, can't find words
- Dissociate — feel like you're watching from outside
- Partner thinks you don't care (you do, you're just stuck)
- Processing happens hours or days later

### Fawn
- Apologize even when you're not wrong
- Abandon your position to keep the peace
- "You're right, I'm sorry" — even when you don't mean it
- Resentment builds underneath

## The Research

John Gottman's research at the "Love Lab" found that conflict itself doesn't predict divorce — **how couples handle conflict does**.<sup>[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.221)</sup>

His "Four Horsemen" of relationship apocalypse:
1. **Criticism** (attacking character, not behavior)
2. **Contempt** (mockery, eye-rolling, disgust)
3. **Defensiveness** (denying responsibility)
4. **Stonewalling** (shutting down, walking away)

**Contempt is the strongest predictor of divorce** — it signals fundamental disrespect. Couples who learn to "repair" — pause, take a break, return to the conversation without the Four Horsemen — fare significantly better. Gottman's research could predict divorce with over 90% accuracy based on these patterns.

## Incompatible Conflict Styles

The real problem isn't your style. It's the mismatch.

| Pairing | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| Fighter + Fighter | Every disagreement escalates. Exhausting for both. |
| Flighter + Flighter | Nothing ever gets resolved. Issues fester. |
| Fighter + Freezer | One attacks, one shuts down. Both feel unheard. |
| Fawner + Anyone | The fawner suppresses, then explodes months later. |

The healthiest pattern? Two people who can recognize their defaults and **choose differently** in the moment.

## Examples

**Kavya (Fight)** — Her voice rises before she even realizes it. In arguments, she can't back down until she feels "heard." Partners have called her "intense" and "aggressive." She doesn't mean to intimidate — but she does.

**Sameer (Flight)** — When things get heated, he leaves. Comes back hours later acting like nothing happened. His ex would chase him around the apartment trying to finish the conversation. He genuinely thought he was "keeping the peace."

**Neha (Freeze)** — When her boyfriend confronts her, she goes blank. Her mind empties. She knows he's waiting for a response but she can't access words. He thinks she's ignoring him. She's drowning.

**Rohan (Fawn)** — In relationships, he apologizes for everything. Disagreement feels dangerous. He'd rather be "wrong" than risk losing someone. Six months in, he snaps — and his partners are blindsided.

## Reflection

- What's your default mode in conflict?
- Has a partner ever said something like "you always shut down" or "you never let things go"?
- How did conflict work in your family growing up?

## One Thing to Try

Next conflict, pause. Notice: *"I'm going into [fight/flight/freeze/fawn] mode right now."*

Just naming it creates space. You don't have to change your response immediately — awareness is the first step. Over time, that pause between trigger and reaction gets longer. That's where choice lives.
