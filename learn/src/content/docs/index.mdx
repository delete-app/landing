## What You'll Learn

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Know Yourself First" icon="sun">
		Most relationships fail because people don't know themselves. Attachment styles, conflict patterns, emotional needs — understand your own before trying to understand someone else's.
	</Card>
	<Card title="The Science of Attraction" icon="heart">
		What's actually happening in your brain when you "fall in love"? Spoiler: that obsessive feeling isn't love — it's limerence. And understanding the difference changes everything.
	</Card>
	<Card title="The Neurodivergent Lens" icon="puzzle">
		Dating with ADHD, autism, or anxiety is different. The hyperfocus phase, rejection sensitivity, time blindness — finally, content that gets it.
	</Card>
	<Card title="More Coming Soon" icon="rocket">
		Compatibility, building long-term bonds, when to walk away. We're adding new content regularly.
	</Card>

## How This Works

Each chapter follows the same format:

1. **Hook** — A scenario you'll probably recognize
2. **The science** — What research actually says (no jargon)
3. **Real examples** — Stories that feel like "wait, that's exactly what happened to me"
4. **Self-reflection** — Questions to think about
5. **Action** — One thing you can do differently

No fluff. No dating advice clichés. Just honest, research-backed insights — like a smart friend who happens to have read all the studies.
