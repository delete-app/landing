> You've swiped right on 500 profiles. Matched with 50. Went on 10 dates. None worked out. The problem isn't the apps. The problem might be you — and that's actually good news.

## The Pattern You Don't See

Most people date on autopilot. They know what they *want* — someone funny, attractive, ambitious — but they don't know who they *are*. And that's the problem.

When you don't understand your own patterns, triggers, and blind spots, you end up:
- Attracting the same "type" that never works out
- Ignoring red flags because they feel familiar
- Self-sabotaging when things get real
- Blaming the apps, the city, or "people these days"

Self-awareness isn't therapy-speak. It's practical. It's the difference between repeating the same mistakes with different faces and actually learning from your experiences.

## What Self-Awareness Actually Means

It's not navel-gazing or endless journaling. Self-awareness in dating means understanding:

1. **Your attachment style** — Are you anxious, avoidant, or secure? (More on this in the next chapter)
2. **Your conflict patterns** — Do you fight, flee, freeze, or people-please?
3. **Your emotional needs** — What makes you feel truly loved? (It's not just "quality time")
4. **Your relationship with yourself** — How you treat yourself sets the baseline for how you let others treat you

## The Research

Studies consistently show that self-awareness predicts relationship satisfaction better than personality compatibility. A 2010 meta-analysis in *Psychological Bulletin* found that people with higher self-awareness:
- Choose more compatible partners
- Communicate needs more effectively
- Leave unhealthy relationships faster
- Report higher relationship satisfaction

The good news? Self-awareness isn't fixed. It's a skill you can develop.

## Reflection

Think about your last few relationships or dating experiences:
- What patterns do you notice?
- What "type" do you keep going for?
- When things ended, what was your role in it?

Be honest. This isn't about blame — it's about awareness.

## One Thing to Do

Before your next swipe, write down:
1. Three things you genuinely need in a partner (not "tall" — think deeper)
2. Three things you bring to a relationship (be honest, not modest)

Keep these somewhere you'll see them. Refer back when you're tempted to ignore what you know.
